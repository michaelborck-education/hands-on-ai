Please write a minimal program using RAG
Copilot said
Here‚Äôs a minimal Python program using the HandsOnAI RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) module to index a folder of documents and query them:

python


Copy
from hands_on_ai.rag import index_documents, query_documents

# Step 1: Index documents in a folder
index_path = index_documents("docs/")  # Replace with your folder path

# Step 2: Ask a question about the indexed content
response = query_documents("What is the main idea?", index_path=index_path)

# Step 3: Print the answer
print(response)
üìù Requirements:

Install the package: pip install hands-on-ai

Ensure your documents are in a supported format: .txt, .pdf, .docx, .md, .py, etc.

Folder "docs/" should contain the files you want to query.

Let me know if you want to add context display, relevance scores, or use it interactively.

Absolutely! Let‚Äôs break down the minimal RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) program and explain what each part does, step by step:

üß† What is RAG?
RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It‚Äôs a technique that combines:

Retrieval: Finding relevant information from documents (like PDFs, text files, etc.)

Generation: Using an LLM to answer questions based on that information

This is useful when you want your AI to answer questions using your own content (e.g., class notes, manuals, articles).

üß™ Minimal RAG Program Explained
python


Copy
from hands_on_ai.rag import index_documents, query_documents
This imports two key functions from the hands_on_ai package:

index_documents: Converts your documents into searchable vector embeddings.

query_documents: Lets you ask questions and get answers based on those indexed documents.

üîπ Step 1: Index Your Documents
python


Copy
index_path = index_documents("docs/")
This scans the folder "docs/" and creates an index file (e.g., index.npz) containing vector representations of the content.

You can point this to any folder with supported files like .txt, .pdf, .docx, .md, .py, etc.

üîπ Step 2: Ask a Question
python


Copy
response = query_documents("What is the main idea?", index_path=index_path)
This sends your question to the LLM.

The system retrieves the most relevant chunks from the indexed documents and uses them as context to generate an answer.

üîπ Step 3: Print the Answer
python


Copy
print(response)
This simply prints the LLM‚Äôs answer to your question.

üõ†Ô∏è What You Need to Run This
Python 3.10+ installed

Install the package:

bash


Copy
pip install hands-on-ai
A folder with documents you want to query (e.g., docs/)

Optionally, set environment variables to choose your model or provider (e.g., OpenAI, Ollama, etc.)

Would you like me to show how to:

Display the source context used in the answer?

Run this from the command line instead of Python?

Use a specific model or provider?

Let me know how you'd like to build on this!
